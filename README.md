    <h4>Career Goals</h4>
    <p style="font-size:11px">I want to pursue entrepreneurship and create my own company to make an impact on the world. In order to reach my goal, I will learn how to program to expand my knowledge. With this knowledge, I will be able to develop my own app that addresses modern-day issues or relates to a product I created.
    Although generating ideas is the most challenging part of entrepreneurship, I already have a concept in mind and now just need the knowledge to bring it to life. I want to become an entrepreneur because I am willing to work hard at the beginning so that I can later make money and support my family.</p>
    <h4>Strengths and Personal Qualities</h4>
    <div>
    <p style="font-size:11px">My experience working in a restaurant highlighted my persistence, organization, ambition, and teamwork—qualities essential for a company's success. During busy times, I learned that staying organized is crucial; otherwise, customers might not receive their drinks, so I manage orders carefully to avoid mistakes. Over nine months, I developed persistence, pushing through overwhelming workloads without giving up. This ability to handle pressure and adapt to customer requests will aid me in entrepreneurship, as giving up too early can lead to failure. Additionally, playing volleyball strengthened my ambition and teamwork skills, as success in the sport relies on being in sync with teammates, similar to collaborating with employees in a business. Volleyball taught me the value of cooperation, essential for efficiency and success, while my passion for the sport motivated me to practice hard. This ambition translates to business; the more driven you are, the harder you’ll work to make your company succeed.
