    <h4>Career Goals</h4>
    <p style="font-size:11px">I want to pursue entrepreneurship and create my own company to make an impact on the world. In order to reach my goal, I will learn how to program to expand my knowledge. With this knowledge, I will be able to develop my own app that addresses modern-day issues or relates to a product I created.
    Although generating ideas is the most challenging part of entrepreneurship, I already have a concept in mind and now just need the knowledge to bring it to life. I want to become an entrepreneur because I am willing to work hard at the beginning so that I can later make money and support my family.</p>
    <h4>Strengths and Personal Qualities</h4>
    <div>
    <p style="font-size:11px">Due to my prior experiences working in a restaurant, the qualities that shine the most are my persistence, organization, ambition, and cooperation, all of which are essential for the success of a company. Working in a restaurant allowed me to realize the importance of organization; during busy times, if I am not organized, some customers may not receive their drinks. To prevent this, I properly manage customer tickets to avoid errors or mistakes. While working there for nine months, I developed persistence, which helped me overcome obstacles; whenever the restaurant is busy and I have to make a lot of drinks, I do not give up or quit, even when the workload feels overwhelming. Being constantly under pressure has actually helped me handle stress and adapt to different customer requests, which will benefit me in entrepreneurship because giving up on a company too early, even if it is bound to succeed, will ultimately lead to failure. My ambition and cooperation shone through while I played volleyball, a team sport where success depends on being on the same wavelength as my teammates. Volleyball has taught me the importance of cooperation, crucial in entrepreneurship, as collaboration with employees is necessary for efficiency and success. Additionally, volleyball helped me develop ambition; I realized I truly enjoyed the sport, motivating me to practice extensively to improve. This drive is important in business because if you are ambitious about something, you are more likely to work harder on your company, which correlates with its success.
